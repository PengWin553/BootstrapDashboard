1. Initialize the project (the root folder)
    Type this in the terminal: npm init -y
2. Create a "public" folder to store the HTML and CSS files
3. Inisde the "public" folder, create an HTML file with the boilerplate code.
4. Go to the tailwindcss.com (or the official tailwind website)
5. Install Tailwind via CLI
    Type this in the terminal: npm i -D tailwindcss

If you look at your current package.json file, it will include the Tailwind dependency.

6. Initialize Tailwindcss (so that the tailwind.configjs file will be created.)
    Type this in the terminal: npx tailwind init

7. Configure the template path (Meaning... specify which files and folders that will utilize tailwind)
    In the tailwind.config.js file, this is what it looks like:

    content: ["./public/**/*.{html, js}"],   //the meanining: ./theRootFolderContainingTheTailwindPresentFiles/lookForSubfolders/*.{look for html and js files that contain tailwind}

    In this example, we'll settle with:

        content: ["./public/*.html"],        //the meaning: we only have the public folder that has no subfolders, which only contaains html files for tailwindcss

8. Create the input.css file.

    Create a new folder in the root folder named "src", and in it, create a new file named "input.css"

    this input.css file contains these three lines:

    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;

9. Create the actual output.css file
    Type this in the terminal:
        npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./public/style.css

10. Add a watch flag  
    Type this in the terminal: 
        npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./public/style.css --watch

    Whenever we make any changes to our input.css file or add any utility classes, we don't have to run the script again and again
    This watch flag will lookout for changes and reruns the tailwind script again automatically

11. When you close the folder and open it again, you have to type the long  npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./public/style.css --watch again.
    Instead, what youll do instead is this in the package.json file:

        "scripts":{
            "build": "npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./public/style.css --watch"
        }

    You'll only have to type "npm run build" to re-run the program again. 

12. Link the html file and the css file to use the tailwind utility classes
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

13. Install Tailwind CSS Intellisense by Tailwind Labs; and live server (if you still don't have it)
